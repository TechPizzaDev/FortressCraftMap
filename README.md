#### Notes
Scanning Hardened Resin will be required to reveal active Hiveminds.  
One active Threat Scanner will be required to reveal enemies. (Slimes will be visible regardless)  
Active CCCCC will be required to reveal Cryo. (Cryo spawners will always be visible regardless)  
Searching by block name will require that block to be scanned.
