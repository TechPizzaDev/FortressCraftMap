  - [ ] Surface Falcors
  - [ ] Falcors on any Y level
- [ ] Chart of current research
  - [ ] Scanned blocks
  - [ ] RP projects
  - [ ] Lab projects
- [ ] Only rendering selected blocks
  - [ ] Select by Regex
    - [ ] Search for item in inventories
    - [ ] Search by block name
- [ ] Location of research parts/drop pods
- [ ] Current attack and wave info
- [ ] World statistics (e.g. production)
- [ ] Ore scan/visualization

#### Not on Roadmap
- Special topography rendering based on vertex normals and time of day

#### Notes
Researching Hardened Resin will be required to reveal active Hiveminds.  
One active Threat Scanner will be required to reveal enemies. (Slimes will be visible regardless)  
Active CCCCC will be required to reveal Cryo. (Cryo spawners will be visible regardless)  
Searching by block name will require that block to be researched.  
Showing location of research parts should be gated behind something (maybe Basic SpiderBot Defences?).  
Items should not be drawn individually not because of performance issues (instancing is a thing) but because of clarity,
a good system where the user can hover over a group of items is preferred (remember a range setting for grouping).
